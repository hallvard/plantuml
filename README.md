# plantuml - generate UML diagrams from files and view them in Eclipse

The plantuml library implements a DSL and renderer for many UML diagrams (class, sequence, objects, states, activities, ...).
See http://plantuml.com for more info about the DSL and renderer.

This project integrates plantuml's functionality into Eclipse, by means of a view that shows a diagram for the currently active editor.
The rendered diagram is typically based on explicit DSL code embedded in the editor, or generated from the content of the editor.

We currently support generating diagrams for
- DSL code embedded in text in any text editor inheriting from the standard eclipse text editor
- the class in the Java editor, based on the Eclipse Java model
- the EClasses in Ecore models in the Ecore editor
- OSGi Manifest files

There's also support for generating a diagram for all the Java classes within one or more Java packages.

Diagram generation is handled by (implementations of) an extension point, called *diagram intent providers* (supersedes *diagram text providers*), so you can customize the process of generating a diagram for other file types or editor content. Each diagram intent provider supports a certain way of generating a diagram from a source, typically the content of an editor. There may be several diagram intent providers for a certain source, so the user may select the desired one.

Each diagram intent provider may support properties that affect details of how diagrams are generated, that may be changed pr. workspace by adding properties in a specific **properties** file in a specific folder. The folder is settable in the PlantUML property sheet. E.g. the diagram intent provider for class diagrams supports two properties,  that controls how attributes' name and type are rendered. Certain other behavior is also controlled by properties in **properties** files, details can be found in Customization.

# Community

We use [Issues](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues) for issue tracking, so head there concerning bugs or suggest features (check if they already exist before adding).

However, we have now (September 2021) started using [Discussions](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/discussions), so please consider it, before use Issues, as the dialog may resolve the issue before it is even raised! Of course, you can also ask questions about how to use PlantUML, tell us about how you use it, comment on where the plug-in should be heading, etc.

- Support for generating diagrams from console output.
- Preference page for enabling/disabling diagram providers.
- Avoid generating diagram (image) when PlantUml view is hidden. 
- Moved list of diagram into sub-menu of view menu, handles [issue #87](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/87).
- Now requires Java 1.8.

## [1.1.22](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/releases/tag/1.1.22)
- Fixes bug ([issue #77](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/77)) concerning incompatibilit with Photon 2018.12.
- The view menu now lists the (explicit) diagrams in a file, so you can select and view it, without navigating inside the file. See ([issue #61](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/61))
- Updated to use PlantUML library version 1.2019.0.

## [1.1.21](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/releases/tag/1.1.21)
- Fixes include bug ([issue #73](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/73)).

## [1.1.20](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/releases/tag/1.1.20)
- Fixes include bug ([issue #35](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/35)) and copying, exporting and printing pages of multi-page diagrams.
- Fixes problem with dangling Ecore objects ([issue #36](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/36))
- Fixes problem with object attribute values with newlines and braces ([issue #37](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/37)) by truncating. Also truncates long attribute value strings, to make object boxes smaller.
- Support for marker:/.../ hyperlinks to specific objects within a file, using the Marker API. Ecore object diagrams now use this kind of marker.
- Fixes problem with missing void operation ([issue #40](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/40)). Also appends "[]" to many-valued types.
- Save action, for exporting image or puml file into workspace, and auto-save feature, for automatically updating saved files when the source changes ([issue #41](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/41)).
- Updated to use PlantUML library version 1.2018.9

## [1.1.19](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/releases/tag/1.1.19)
- Support for the newpage directive. Multi-page diagrams are rendered as numbered tabs ([issue #11](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/11)).
- Support generating packages for project class diagram, and a preference to turn on/off ([issue #18](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/18)).
- Object diagram generator, currently used as a default for Ecore model instances. To support overriding this behavior, e.g. so an Ecore model for state machines can be rendered as state diagrams, diagram text providers can now have a priority ([issue #33](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/33)).
- Refactored project layout, to conform to Eclipse conventions. Prepared for separating PlantUML library and Eclipse plugins update sites, so they can be released separately. The library plugin and feature has changed to same versioning as the jar.

## [1.1.18.8059](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/releases/tag/1.1.18.8059)
- Support links to fully qualified java classes with java scheme links ([issue #31](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/31)), e.g. java:java.lang.String. Add a fragment to navigate to a specific member. Default diagram generation from java source now uses this kind of link.
- Fix problem with enums in project class diagrams, where associations where generated for the literals ([issue #30](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/30)).

## [1.1.17.8059](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/releases/tag/1.1.17.8059)
- Hyperlinks that are just paths or use the platform scheme are opened in the default Eclipse editor ([issue #25](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/25)). Class diagrams generated from Java code utilize this feature by including navigatable path links.

## [1.1.16.8059](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/releases/tag/1.1.16.8059)
- Open several PlantUML views and pin them to a specific resource ([issue #21](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/21)). Please comment on the behaviour.
- Support for hyperlinks, see http://plantuml.com/link ([issue #24](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/24))

## [1.1.14.8059](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/releases/tag/v1.1.14.8059)
- Experimental support for generating a class diagram for a set of Java files ([issue #18](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/18)). Open the PlantUML Project Class Diagram and drag a Java project or package into the view (suggest improvements by adding a comment to the issue).
- support for generating class diagram for .class files shown in the Class File editor

## 1.1.13.8054
- Includes EPL-ed version of plantuml.jar
- Fix for [issue #13](https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/issues/13) - recompute diagram on activate not just broughtOnTop
